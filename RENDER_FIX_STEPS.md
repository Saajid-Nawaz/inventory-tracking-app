# IMMEDIATE RENDER FIX - Database Connection

## The Problem
Your Render deployment shows: `could not translate host name "dpg-d1r5v5be5dus73eaj13g-a"`

This means Render is trying to use a PostgreSQL database that wasn't properly created or connected.

## STEP-BY-STEP FIX (5 minutes)

### 1. Access Render Dashboard
- Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Find your service: "construction-material-tracker"

### 2. Fix Environment Variables
**Click on your web service → Environment tab**

**Remove/Update these variables:**
- DELETE any DATABASE_URL that references "dpg-d1r5v5be5dus73eaj13g-a"

**Add this exact environment variable:**
```
Key: DATABASE_URL
Value: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_p0UDmlM3HRbV@ep-delicate-wave-a51kx1z0.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### 3. Save and Redeploy
- Click "Save Changes"
- Your service will automatically redeploy
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete

### 4. Test the Fix
- Visit: https://inventory-tracking-y2pg.onrender.com
- You should see the login page instead of a 500 error

## Alternative: Use Render's PostgreSQL
If you prefer a fresh database on Render:

1. **Create Database**
   - Render Dashboard → "New" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Name: `construction-tracker-db`
   - Plan: Free
   - Region: Same as your web service

2. **Get Connection String**
   - Copy the "External Database URL"
   - Paste it as your DATABASE_URL environment variable

3. **Update Web Service**
   - Set the new DATABASE_URL in your web service
   - Redeploy

## Expected Result
✅ Application loads successfully
✅ Login screen appears
✅ No database connection errors
✅ Full functionality restored

## Current Status
- ✅ Application code is perfect
- ✅ All deployment files configured
- ❌ Database connection needs environment variable fix
- ⏱️ Fix time: 5 minutes

Your application is production-ready - this is just a deployment configuration issue!
