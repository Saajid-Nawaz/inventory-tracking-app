üìã Build an Inventory Tracking & Approval App (MVP) ‚Äî Web and Mobile Ready

Build a role-based inventory tracking and material issuing application for a construction/site environment.  
It should run as a web app (responsive/mobile-friendly) and be structured cleanly so it can later be packaged as a phone app.  

---

üéØ **Overview:**
The app tracks materials at multiple construction sites.  
There are two user roles:  
- Storesman: manages stock at their assigned site.  
- Site Engineer: oversees one or more sites, approves requests, and manages Storesmen.

All material movements must be logged with a unique transaction ID and timestamp. Reports must be exportable as PDF or Excel.

---

üë§ **User Roles & Permissions:**

**Storesman:**
- Receive materials into stock at their assigned site.
- Submit a request to issue materials out of stock (requires Site Engineer approval).
- Submit batch issue requests for multiple materials.
- Generate and download PDF reports of all material issues (daily), with unique serial numbers per transaction.
- View current stock at their site and compare to total materials received.

**Site Engineer:**
- Add/edit Storesmen and assign each to a specific site.
- View stock at each site.
- Approve or reject material issue requests (single and batch).
- View total available stock per site and export stock summary as PDF or Excel.
- Monitor stock levels against predefined minimum/reorder thresholds and get notified if below.

---

üì¶ **Inventory Features:**
- Track stock by site, material name/ID, quantity, unit cost, and total value.
- Use FIFO as default valuation (extensible to weighted average later).
- Allow setting minimum/reorder levels per material per site.
- Periodic stock counts and adjustments, with discrepancies logged.
- Full transaction history for each material at each site.
- Optionally link each issue transaction to a job/project code.

---

üìä **Reporting & Export:**
- Daily issued materials report (PDF) per site, with unique transaction serials.
- Stock summary report (PDF/Excel) per site.
- Full material transaction history view/downloadable.

üñ•Ô∏è **Technical Notes:**
- Responsive UI (web and mobile-friendly) using modern web framework (React preferred or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
- Backend database: SQLite or Firestore for MVP.
- Code structure: Modular, MVC-friendly, scalable.
- Authentication: username/password with role-based access (Storesman/Site Engineer).
- Generate unique transaction IDs (sequential or UUID).
- Dashboard with analytics for Site Engineer is a nice-to-have.

üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema:**

**Tables/Collections:**
- `users` (id, username, password_hash, role [storesman/site_engineer], assigned_site_id)
- `sites` (id, name, location)
- `materials` (id, name, unit, description, cost_per_unit, minimum_level)
- `stock_levels` (id, site_id, material_id, quantity, updated_at)
- `transactions` (id, site_id, material_id, quantity, type [receive/issue/adjustment], issued_to_project_code, approved_by, created_by, created_at, serial_number)

üåê **Suggested API Endpoints:**

**Auth**
- `POST /login` ‚Äî authenticate user

**Users & Sites**
- `GET /users`
- `POST /users`
- `GET /sites`
- `POST /sites`

**Materials & Stock**
- `GET /materials`
- `POST /materials`
- `GET /stock_levels?site_id=`
- `POST /receive_material`
- `POST /request_issue`
- `POST /approve_issue`
- `GET /transactions?site_id=&material_id=`

**Reports**
- `GET /reports/daily_issues?site_id=`
- `GET /reports/stock_summary?site_id=`

‚úÖ **Goal:**  
Build a functional MVP web app with responsive UI, role-based controls, unique audit trail for all stock movements, and clean extensible codebase that can later be converted to a native phone app.  

Focus on:  
- Clear roles & permissions  
- Accurate stock tracking with valuations  
- Exportable reports  
- Notifications (low stock/pending approvals) ‚Äî optional for MVP

Output working code with clean comments and README. Use best practices for scalability and maintainability.
