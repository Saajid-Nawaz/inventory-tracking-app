# âœ… COMPREHENSIVE ROUTE & FUNCTIONALITY FIX

## All Missing Routes Resolved for Render Deployment

### **Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **Missing Route Aliases** - Added redirect aliases for all missing routes:
   - `/bulk_import` â†’ `/excel_operations`
   - `/issue_requests` â†’ `/approve_requests`
   - `/generate_report` â†’ `/reports`
   - `/export_excel` â†’ Direct Excel report generation
   - `/export_pdf` â†’ Direct PDF report generation
   - `/issue_material` â†’ `/request_materials`
   - `/stock_transfers` â†’ `/stock_transfer`
   - `/batch_receive` â†’ `/bulk_receive_materials`

2. **Report Generation Routes** - Added fully functional direct export routes:
   - `/export_excel` generates instant Excel stock reports
   - `/export_pdf` generates instant PDF stock reports
   - Both include proper error handling and fallbacks

3. **Enhanced Error Handlers** - Added comprehensive error handling:
   - 404 errors: Graceful redirects to appropriate dashboards
   - 500 errors: Database rollback and safe redirects
   - 403 errors: Access denied handling
